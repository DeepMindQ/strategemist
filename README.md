# DeepMindQ — AI-Powered Revenue Intelligence

> **"The goal is not to build more screens. The goal is that every screen becomes powered by reliable AI intelligence."**

DeepMindQ is an enterprise-grade, AI-native Application that transforms revenue intelligence from reactive dashboards into proactive, evidence-backed selling machines. Built on a composable 7-engine architecture where every AI output follows the chain: **Signal → Reason → Evidence → Confidence → Business Impact → Recommended Action**.

---

## Architecture Overview

### Complete AI Flow

```
User Action → Screen → API Route → Engine Layer → Retrieval/Grounding → Model Router → LLM → Structured Output → UI
```

### 7-Engine Architecture (Phase A + B)

**Foundation Engines** (call LLMs, collect evidence, retrieve knowledge):

| Engine | Purpose | Key Technology |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **ModelRouter** | Tiered LLM routing with automatic fallback | Z.ai GLM → Gemini → Groq Llama (Deep/Smart/Fast tiers) |
| **GroundingEngine** | Unified evidence chain builder with citations + confidence | Multi-source evidence collection, freshness decay, gap detection |
| **RetrievalEngine** | Local semantic search with zero-cost embeddings | @xenova/transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384-dim) + TF-IDF fallback |

**Composition Engines** (orchestrate foundation engines to produce output):

| Engine | Purpose | Input | Output |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| **SynthesisEngine** | Evidence-grounded briefs (1200-2000 words) | Evidence + Knowledge + LLM (Deep tier) | Structured brief with [En] citations, per-section confidence, hallucination detection |
| **ScoringEngine** | Explainable revenue intelligence scoring | Evidence + LLM (Smart tier) | Score + factor breakdown + reasoning + evidence + confidence |
| **ActionEngine** | Next-best-action + sales motion recommendations | Evidence + Score + LLM (Smart tier) | Action + why + why now + message + timing + confidence |
| **ConversationEngine** | Persona-aware meeting prep + conversation planning | Evidence + Contact + LLM (Smart tier) | Talking points + questions + objections + positioning + topics to avoid |

### AI Reliability Layer

Every AI output includes these reliability primitives:
- **Confidence Score** (0-100%) — calibrated against evidence quality
- **Evidence References** — [En] citation markers with source attribution
- **Freshness Timestamp** — exponential decay from signal date
- **Source Attribution** — reliability-weighted (SEC.gov: 0.95, LinkedIn: 0.75, etc.)
- **Hallucination Prevention** — citation parser detects fabricated [En] markers
- **Failed Generation Handling** — non-throwing contract (success + error, never throws)
- **Token/Cost Tracking** — per-generation auditing via EngineRun records

Action: Schedule executive discussion with VP Data
Why: Company entering cloud modernization phase
Why Now: 14-day decision window (RFP deadline approaching)
Message: "We noticed your cloud modernization initiative..."
Expected Impact: High — VP Data is actively evaluating vendors
Confidence: 85% — 4 signals, 2 contacts, hiring pattern
```

### ConversationEngine Output (Persona-Aware)

```
Buyer: CIO at Fortune 500 manufacturing company
Priorities: 1. Regulatory compliance  2. Data modernization  3. Cost optimization
Questions to Ask: "What challenges are you facing managing AI governance?"
Topics to Avoid: Leading with cost reduction (buyer is ROI-positive)
Positioning: Enterprise AI control layer
Objections: "We already have a data team" → "Your team is the reason this will succeed"

## Design Principles

### Evidence-First AI
Every AI output cites evidence with [En] markers. Hallucinated citations are detected and penalized. Coverage gaps are acknowledged explicitly.

### Non-Throwing Engine Contract
All engines return `{ success: boolean, error: string | null, ... }`. Failures degrade gracefully — a failed Deep tier call falls back to Smart, then Fast, then structured error.

### Zero-Cost Intelligence Stack
Default LLM providers all have free tiers (Z.ai, Gemini, Groq). Local embeddings via @xenova/transformers ($0). Paid providers (NVIDIA, OpenAI) are opt-in.

### Source Reliability Hierarchy
```
SEC.gov (0.95) > Bloomberg (0.92) > Crunchbase (0.85) > LinkedIn (0.75) > TechCrunch (0.78) > Default (0.60)
```
